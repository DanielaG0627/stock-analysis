# Stock Analysis for Steve

## Project Overview

This VBA script was written for Steve who needed to provide insight into stock performance for his parents. As first time investors, Steve's parents were interested in the performance of the DOQ stock. Upon analyzing the results of the DOQ stock performance, Steve decided he wanted to perform the analysis for all stocks within the data set to advise his parents of other potential stocks to invest in. The VBA script was refactored to include variables that would analyze the performance of all stocks in the data set provided and produce a formatted summary.

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

One of the advantages of refactoring code is that the code can be optimized for performance or reused to achieve a similar end-goal as the original code.
One of the disadvantages of refactoring code is that if it is not properly commented or structured, you may spend more time trying to figure out what the code is doing than it would take to write a new program. You may also be refactoring old code which you may have forgotten the structure of.


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The above-mentioned advantage of refactoring code applies to the original VBA script because the Green Stocks code was refactored to optimize the execution time of the code, as well as incorporating variables to remove hard-coded values, which also improved the quality of the code.

The disadvantage mentioned doe snot apply to the refactored VBA script as I was refactoring code that was recently written and I knew what the purpose of each section was.
